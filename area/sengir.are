Small Black Bat~
Small Black Bat~
The small black bat mesmerizes you with it's wings.
~
This "small" black bat has a wing span of about 6 feet. His long, sharp wings 
tell you quickly how this animal attacks. He is a graceful flier and calms 
you as you watch him swoop in and out of the trees. His sharp canine teeth 
points out his love of meat. Obviously a member of the Phyllostomadae.

Jamison, First Knight~
Jamison, the King's First Knight stands here protecting the passage.
~
This is a large man dressed in a tight chainmail tunic and no helm. 
His arms are covered by a thin, paper-like armor which glows a dull blue. 
His face is grim and he looks about shaking his head in disbelief.  It
doesn't look like the armies of the undead have found him yet...  If they
do...

The Forest~
You are at the edge of the forest.  Ahead of you, behind a wide moat, you
can see a large fortress.  Whoever lives here must not like visitors much. 
As you pick your way through the underbrush, the drawbridge opens and a
rider passes over it, heading for a small path off to your right. 
Fortunately, he didn't see you.

Entrance to Castle Sengir~
The huge palace is surrounded by a large metal fence.  You pull your
cloak tighter as the wind picks up.  Looking up you see a large black stone
palace with five towers, one extending high above the rest.  The gate creaks
as you go onward on the path.  Looking south you see a path leading away
from this quite intimidating Castle.  Looking north you see the path, which
leads to the Castle.

The Path Leading to the Castle~
The path is made up of a hard, packed dirt, although there is no dust. 
The path leads up to what appears to be two huge doors, several hundred
yards to the north.  There is a huge hedge to the east and west of you which
stands around 12' high.  The razor sharp thorns forces you to continue north
or south.  You think you see a break in the hedge big enough to go through
to the northeast but you can't be sure.

The break in the bush offers a small alcove cut into the hedge.  The
high walls and razor sharp thorns offer you protection from the elements as
well as black, flying creatures..  The air almost feels warmer here as if
there is someone wathing over you.  There is a bed here offering a safe
place to sleep.

The Path Outside of the Castle~
The path continues quite haphazardly in a northern direction.  You can
barely see for the night?  Is thrust into complete darkness.  You start to
doubt yourself as you pass the large gates you saw from afar.  You now
realize that the fence surrounded nothing except a large wall.  The doorway
is now only a short distance away.  You want to turn around but you trek
onward...  The wall is now in front of you...  The cold gray stone extend to
the east and west.  The walls end in high towers on both sides.

The Palace Doors~
You look up at the largest doors you have ever seen.  These 30' high
doors are as black as the night you just came in on.  The mohogony is
accented with reinforced iron plates which are, of course, jet-black.  The
arched doorway is a deep grey stone which extends to the two towers which
are visible to you from here.  You wonder if you can even open the massive
doors without an army.  Nevertheless you must try.

Your light cuts through the darkness producing an ornate foyer.  You
feel the warmth of the light because the room is brightly decorated.  The
floor is covered in bright, colorful rugs and the walls are covered with
painting.  There is a stairway leading up to the next level, although you
can't see for the lack of light.  The large door remains open behind you and
there are archways leading to the east and west.

Dining Room~
This huge room is as sterotypical a dining room as it gets.  There is a
long table in the middle of the room which has chairs on either side.  The
walls are richly decorated with paintings and tapestries.  The only thing
that is strange about this room is that the windows are blacked out.  The
thick layer of dust points out how long this place has been uninhabited for
a while.  There is still the remains of a long forgotten meal on the table. 
You start to wonder where the people who were eating it went.

foyer or there is an archway leading to the north.  The only thing you

middle of the room.  There is a small wash basin for cleaning up and there
is a fireplace to heat the room.  The floor is cold tile and there is no
place to put any type of clothing at all.  Back to the south is the hallway.

Outside Northwest Wall~
The high gray walls stand about 30' high.  The smooth rock makes
climbing impossible although a magical being could perhaps fly up to the
battlements.  The path leads back to the front of the castle and to the west
to the corner of the wall.

The NW Tower Outside the Castle~
The tall, thin tower rises up out of the dark soil.  It is almost 70'
tall with what seems to be a small guard room on the top.  A single blacked
out window faces this northerly direction.  The path returns you to the
front entrance to the east and around to the western wall to the north.

Outside the Western Wall~
This wall has long black streaks down it.  The streaks were obviously
oil being poured down them in the effort of protection these once sacred
walls.  The ground is still covered in gray earth which compliments the dark
gray stone of the wall.  The path leads south and north.

As with the other towers, this one has a single blacked out window
facing the south.  The high tower walls are clean and the gray rock seems
bleached by the sun.  The smooth rock reflects the dim sunlight and you can
barely see the top of this tower.  To the east you see a thin trail leading
to the north wall and to the south is the western wall.

Outside the Southern Wall~
You wonder why this castle wasn't equiped with a "backdoor" until you
take a peek over the cliff to the south.  The castle's walls are still
heavily stained with oil and tar stains as well as bits of armor strewn
about the thin path leading off in both directions.  The south is a cliff,
the north is the castle, the west is a path, and the east is a path.

The NE Tower Outisde the Castle~
This wall rises up out of the landscape posing an inpenetrable boundry
to the south.  There is great staining and burn scars all along the wall. 
This was obviously a key position for the battle that conquered this realm. 
A pile of rubble lies to the east and blocks the path to the SE tower.  A
path returns you to the front gate.

The SE Tower Outside the Castle~
You stand at the base of a huge tower.  The base of a cliff is directly
behind you.  The long smooth stone wall runs to the south and to the west. 
Your mind starts to wander as you walk along the wall but as you turn the
tight corner onto the eastern half of the castle a strong gust of wind
almost blows you off the ground.  You crouch down and pull your cloak
tighter just knowing it is going to be a long night...

The light shines off of the tall gray wall.  You notice that each brick
is set into the wall almost perfectly.  The path is only a few meters wide
and there is a sheer cliff opposite the great wall.  The cliff drops several
dozen feet and ends in a small patch of stalagmites.  The path leads north
and south, there is no way down the cliff.

walls and floors.  The tile is even kept warm here by some unknown source. 
To the south is the foyer, to the north the sanctum.  The sun slowly

until in the distance you can see a large golden throne with a big man
sitting in the throne.  The man is flanked by two big armored men wielding
polearms.

Front Portulagus of Castle Sengir~
The front of the castle has old banners hanging from the battlements. 
The dark gray stone has stains of oil and blood as it looks to have been the
home of a great battle not to far in the past.  The arrow slits are still
wide open and you are quite fearful that an arrow could still exit the small
opening.  The huge grate is raised and you just know that you shouldn't
continue much farther but something drives you onward.  There are two small
guard rooms on either side of the grate as you walk into the castle.

rack sitting beside the door is empty as is the stand for the guard's armor.
There is a door leading to the east which you suppose is a place where the
guards sleep.  To the west is the castle gate, which stands open.

until the castle was overtaken a couple of weeks into the war.  The books
are in great condition and it seems that whoever took the castle either
wanted these records to be seen or they didn't know what they were. 
Nevertheless these books are very interesting even if not valuable.  You are
quite sure that they are safer here than on your person so you leave them
here.

The sky seems more clear here as you stray from the center of the

The street itself is well traveled and there are many hoofprints along this
path.  To the north is a small garden with hanging plants.  The garden seems
pleasent enough until you realize that this has been the only plantlife
short of the grass.  To the south is an old burned down warehouse. 
Continuing to the east is a north/south intersection.

beyond repair by some sort of claw or claws.  The furniture has been moved
around and sits in a somewhat orderly fashion around a single burning
candle.  The small candle burns without heat and without wax.  To the west

Sengir.  There are human remains scattered around the castle.  You surge

the shops along the way do have second floors but you wonder if the floors
could hold your weight anyway.  The palace lies to the north, and is looking
quite interesting.

dirt kicks up dust as you walk.  To the east you see an old weaponsmiths
shop and to the west you see an old general store.  The south leads you back
to the front gate and the north takes you toward the magnificant palace. 
The tower that was so visible through the midnight black sky is now directly
in front of you.  It extends over a 100' high and is decorated with gold
trim on a dark stone foundation.  It is a work of art.

Upstairs of Sengir House~
This floor is in as good of condition as the first floor was.  The soft
carpeting of the floor makes you realize that this ws once owned by a
nobleman of Sengir.  The rooms are all opened as there are no doors.  The
clock still ticks even today.  The only exit is back down the steps.  As far
as you can tell the only thing bizarre about this room is that the windows
are blacked out and the bed has been replaced by four small coffins.  You
wonder why there would be coffins in a house...

This is an ornate room in the back of the house.  This is where the
coffins are.  You examine the coffins and notice that they are clean and
have been used?  Recently.  You again notice that there are no windows and
the rooms are completely dark.  The stairs are to the west.

Hall of Kings~
The throne is only a dozen feet away and you already feel the sheer
power radiating from it.  You start to realize that the king was a kind and
just ruler and was heartlessly slain by the undead that now control his
kingdom.  The hall is still immaculate and you can see your reflection in
the highly polished marble pillars.  To the south is more of the hall
including the rest of the palace.  To the north is the precious throne.

Hall of Kings~
Here you stand in front of the mighty King of Sengir.  The floor is
scattered with rose petals and there are feight signs of burns across the
floor.  The King's bodyguards stand, one on each side, with grim looks
across there gentle faces.  The throne itself is 9 feet tall with solid gold
posts and a leather based chair.  There are passages going to the east and
west here.

the rug on the ground.  This room was once richly decorated but now it sits
without much in it.  To the east is the Throne room.  In the northern wall
is an archway which leads off into another group of chambers.

Here is where the largest battle of the town was fought.  The southern
wall been damaged and the ground is still scorched.  The SW guard tower is
to the west or south of you here.  It rises many feet above you.  Winkle
street is directly north of you and the entrence to the Castle is to the
east.  There are areas of absolute armaggedon and then areas untouched by
anything.  You wonder why.

here for the off duty guards and there are a few small, now empty, quarters.
The dust is thick as there is little going on in these towers anymore. 
These were once the second line of defense for the Castle.  The guards used
to flood out of the towers and annihilate anything in there way...  Course
that was the past.

Many arrows and arrow slits line the walls as do fire pits for the hot oil
cualdrons.

This is the top of the tower.  You could see for miles from up here
were it not for the thick fog that envelops the land.  This was a marksmans'
spot for shooting down raiders and invaders so there are many broken bow
strings and such littering the cold stone floor.  The tower is well
protected as it is some 50' tall and has stone walls protecting it.  To the
north you can make out parts of the small Sengir town along with the ornate
Palace in the north part of town.

still filled with oil.  The quivers still sit leaning against the wall where
they are still filled with dozens of arrows.  There are several sets of
remains laying strewn about here.  The battlement leads to the SE and the SW

for it ws obviously key in protecting the castle at one point.  The smooth,
hard rock looks inviting to your tired soul, yet you know that you are in
danger here...  You hear the flapping of wings here but you don't know if
you can see anything.

here for it hasn't been cleaned in quite some time but other than that it is
pretty normal.  The battlement leads to the NE Tower and the SE Tower.  You

concrete blocks that once formed a dark gray wall is now reduced to rubble. 
You wonder what could have caused such mass destruction.  The walkway to the
north, leading to the NW Tower, is almost impassible but you think that you
can make it across.  It would be a long way to fall if the walkway fails.

Northern Battlements~
This small walkway joins the NW and the NE tower.  Tradicionally
speaking, battlements were used in the protection of the castle.  These
small planks are protected with about 3 feet of cement and stone.  The
battlements were where the volleys of arrows would rain down on enemies
approaching the castle.  From the battlements huge cauldrons of hot oil
would also be poured on the heads of unsuspecting troops.  You could go east
and west to either of the towers.

piles of rock.  Innes street runs east and west to your north and Sengir

cleaning and cooking although they don't look to be of much interest.  There

are no doors to anywhere and the room is very messy with clothes thrown
about the area.  The bed is unmade and there are stacks of dishes in a
bucket.  You think you smell some stew brewing but you are not sure, why
would there be food worthy of mortals in a place of the undead?

Northern Winkle Street~
An otherwising uninteresting part of town.  This was once where the old
arena was but of course it is nothing but rubble.  To the south is the road
leading to the square and to the north is the palace courtyard.  The ground
here is pretty well traveled and there is a slight odor in the air.

End of Winkle Street~
This is the western front of the palace fence.  There is a large wooden
fence still in wonderful condition in front of you.  The fence looks as
though it hasn't been touched in years.  There is a dull glow from the fence
which makes you think that it is magically protected.  To the west is the
front gate leading to the palace proper.  To south leads back to the
intersection which is home to the square.

Entrance to the Lair~
This it a dark hole that leads to the home of a rather large beast. 
You are not sure that you want to meet something as big as the beast that
scratched a cave like this.  There is 8 feets worth of clearance to the
ceiling and there are 10-12 feet between walls.  The path leads to the
north.

Hall Leading to the Lair~
This is the Hall that leads to the lair of the beast.  You can tell
from all the dust that the creatuire has wings.  You examine the depth of
the scratches and you realize that the claws are about 7-8 inches long each.
You arean't quite sure if you want to continue but you surge forth anyway.

You don't know what to think.  This Beast sits on top of a massive pile
of treasure.  His huge gaping teeth instill the fear of God upon you but yet
you fight onward.  Perhaps you can get all the treasure when you kill this
menace to the generations to coem.  Nevertheless...  Good luck...  You are

Empty House~
A small room with a large pool in the middle of it makes you think that
this wasn't a house.  Perhaps a bath house at some point, but certainly not
a residence.  There is a solid iron rod that surrounds the bath tub.  The
steps that lead into the tub are broken although with some effort you think
that you could make it down into the bottom.  The water was deep at some
point but of course now it is empty.  You can see anything at the bottom of
the pool.

small carpet in the middle of the room, and the edges are frayed and
decaying.  There isn't anything on the walls and the ceiling shows nothing

people to the east near the square as if there is something important there.

from intruders.  The ground here is heavily worn and there are shouts coming
from within the shack itself.  The palace itself rises up in front of you as
a magestic high roofed building.  There are the standard 5 towers in the
palace with 4 in the corners and one huge one rising up in the middle.  Back

First Floor of the NW Tower~
At every corner of the palace and the castle are towers which are used
as protection for the respective dwelling.  This is a three story tower with
arrow slits along the walls.  To the south is the palace library and there
is a set of stairs leading to the second level.  Overall this part of the
tower is in good condition.

Library of the Palace~
This is the royal library.  Where there were once large bookshelves
there is now piles of broken up wood and burned books.  Obviously whomever
took over the palace thought that it is better not to have such propaganda
sitting around here.  To the south is the study and to the north is the
tower.  This room is very large with no windows and no intact furniture.

This is the highest part of this tower.  There are arrow slits which
face out into what appears to be nothing but you think that they were put
there to fend off flying creatures.  There are some small blood stains which
are on the floor which indicates a fair sized fight was fought here at some
point.

Third Floor of the NW Tower~
This is the top of the NW tower.  There was a large battle here
whenever the main siege was occuring.  There is a set of stairs which leads
down to the second level of the palace and to the bedrooms and other parts
of the palace.  The tower is still intact although there are many
bloodstains and scratches in the walls and on the floor.

Hidden Room~
This small room was once used for the rest of the royal family when
there was a siege or battle close by.  There are three small but clean beds
across the three walls away from the door.  There is a small rack where
weapons were once kept which is now empty.  There is little else of interest
in here though.

Small Washroom~
This is a small washroom that was used by the royal guests.  There is a
small tub here and a hole in the floor which appears to be for human wastes.
There is a somewhat acrid smell here and the small washbasin is lying on the
floor broken in many places.

Another part of the path around the palace.  To the SE is the NW tower
which rises high into the sky.  You see a path to the south and to the east.
There are burns on the outside of the palace and you think the fence has a
slight glow here.  Examination of the fence shows nothing though.

To the east and west are paths.  Other than that there is nothing here
except for the palace to the south and the fence to the north.  The ground
is flattened from the guard's tracks and you see on the outside of the
palace where there were battles, marked by the scortch marks and arrow
slits.

Outside the NW Tower of the Palace~
This is the corner of the palace property.  The palace rises up in
front of you piercing the sky with its high towers.  To the south is a path
leading to the front of the palace.  The fence which is pretty high itself
protects the palace further even though the castle walls surround the palace
in it's entirety.

Outside the East Wall of the Palace~
This path is nothing more than a place that the guards can search.  The
area in between the palace and the fence is in good condition even though
there are almost always guards floating through here.  To the north is the
path going around the corner of the palace and to the south the same.  To
the west it the palace itself and to the east is the fence.

to lead all around the palace.  To the north is the palace itself and to the
south is the fence which protects the palace from siege although the castle
walls completely enclose the palace itself.

This is an open air floor of the tower.  You can see the start of the
Winkle street.  The tower seems to be in good condition and there is little
damage like there were on some of the other towers.  There is a small spiral
staircase leading back down to the palace proper.

There is a small spiral stairwell leading back down into the palace.  Other
than that there is nothing of interest.

King's Retreat~
This small room once was built for the king to retreat to if there was
an attempt on his life.  The room is plain, although it still has that royal
touch of a grand gold boardered painting on the north wall.  Perhaps a
closer look at the painting would be appropriate.  To the south is the only
exit which leads to the western antechamber.

painting~
This painting is truely magnificent.  You look closely at it and see
the delicate colors and the perfect brush strike that was used to create
such a fine peace.  You also notice that there is a perfectly hidden passage
that the painting covers.  Perhaps you should ENTER PAINTING.

Hidden Passageway~
This is amazing...  You step through the passage into the painting and
end up here.  You are not sure where here is but you know that the
passageway you just came through is no longer open.  The painting swung back
and sealed itself leaving nowhere to go but into the darkness...  To the
north.

Hidden Passage~
The passageway continues to the north and back to the south.  There
is really nothing to be seen in the darkness.  The walls are a smooth stone
with no lighting nor decoration.  The ground is a hard packed dirt with no
covering.  Perhaps a search farther to the north will show something of
interest.

Hidden Passage~
This is just another passageway.  There appears to be a large room to
the north that is lit with a number of torches.  The passageway leads back
to the south and appears to lead no where important.  You can feal the evil
to the north.  Approach with fear.

Hidden Chamber~
This appears to be the room where the queen is rushed during times of
seige.  You don't recall the decline in altitude but you realize that the
room seems to be below the ground.  The room is cool and fairly well lit. 
There are two thrones sitting on the northern half of the room and a
passageway to the south.
