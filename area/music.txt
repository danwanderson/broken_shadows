I Still Haven't Found What I'm...~
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
Only to be with you
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm as the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
But yes I'm still running
You broke the bonds
You loosed the chains
You carried the cross
And my shame
And my shame
You know I believe it
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

Some people call me the space cowboy.
Yea...
Some call me the gangster of love.
Some people call me Maurice.
Cause I speak of the pompotous of love.
People talk about me baby.
Say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong.
Well you worry, baby, don't worry.
Cause I'm right here, right here,
Right here, right here at home.
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner,
I'm a lover, I'm a sinner.
I play my music in the sun.
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker.
I'm midnight toker.
I get my lovin' on the run.
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see.
I really love your peaches. Wanna shake your tree.
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time.
Ohey, baby, I'll sure show you a good time.
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner,
I'm a lover, I'm a sinner.
I play my music in the sun.
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker.
I'm midnight toker.
Sure don't want to hurt no one.
People keep talking about me, baby.
Say I'm doing you wrong.
Well you worry, don't worry,
No don't worry mama.
Cause I'm right here at home.
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see.
I really love your peaches. Wanna shake your tree.
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time.
Come on baby. Show me a good time.

With or Without You~
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Slight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait....without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised, she's got me with
Nothing left to win
And nothing else to lose
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

Hotel California~
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of Colitas
Rising up in the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dimmer
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
You can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany Twisted
She's got the Mercades Benz  Mmmm
She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
Please bring me my wine
He said
We haven't had that spirit here since 1969.
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
Such a nice suprise
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
Pink champagin on ice
She said, "We are all just prisioners here, of our own device."
In the Master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
Stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
Relax, said the night man
We Are programed to recieve
You can check out any time you like
But you can't ever leave.

Don't Turn Around~
If you gotta leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go darlin'
Maybe it's better that way
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
*Walk out that door yeah see if I care just go on and go*
But don't turn around
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know
I won't let you know
I won't miss your arms around me, holding me tight
And if you ever think about me, just know that I'll be all right
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
*I will survive I'll make it through I may learn to live without you*
Don't turn around
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
I wish I could scream out loud that I love you
I wish I could say to you don't go
As he walks away he feels the pain getting strong
People in your life that don't know what's going on
Are too proud to turn around, and he's gone
Don't turn around
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
Baby, don't turn around...

Until It Sleeps~
Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run but it stays right by my side
So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me, Until it sleeps
Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays...
Now it stays
So tear me open, but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me, until I'm clean
It grips you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hold you so hold me, Until it sleeps
So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your grief
Don't want it
So tear me open, make you gone
No longer would you hurt anyone
and the fear still shakes me, so hold me, until it sleeps
It grips you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It holds you holds you holds you, Until it sleeps
I don't want it, want it, want it, want it...
Want it, want it, no, no, no, no..
So tear me open, but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me, 'til I'm clean
Tear me open, make you gone
No longer would you hurt anyone
And the hate still shames me
So hold me
Until it sleeps

Everything I Do I Do It For You~
Look into my eyes and you will see
What you mean to me
Search you heart, search your soul
And when you find me there you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth trying for
Can't tell me it's not worth dying for
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you
Look into your heart
And you will find
There's nothing there to hide
Take me as I am
Take my life
I would give it up
I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you
There's no love
Like your love
And no other
Could give more love
There's no way, unless you're there
All the time, all the way
You can't tell me it's not worth trying for
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more
I would fight for you
I'd lie for you
Cross the world for you
Yeah, I'd die for you
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you...

The Unforgiven II~
Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's opened if you're true
If you can understand the me, I can understand the you
Lay beside me, under wicked skies
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this pair of lives
The door cracks open,
But there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still,
But there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...
What I've felt, What I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door,
Should I open it for you?
What I've felt, What I've known,
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, Cause I'm the one who waits for you..
Or are you unforgiven, too?
Lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still,
But she'll never love again
She lay beside me, But she'll be there when I'm gone
Yeah she'll be there when I'm gone
Yeah she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...
What I've felt, What I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door,
Should I open it for you?
What I've felt, What I've known,
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, Cause I'm the one who waits for you..
Or are you unforgiven, too?
Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun
Now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it...
What I've felt, What I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door,
Should I open it for you?
What I've felt, What I've known,
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, Cause I'm the one who waits for you..
Or are you unforgiven, too?
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, Should I open it for you?
So I dub thee unforgiven
What I've felt, what I've known
I take this key and bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven, too
Never free, never me
'Cause you're unforgiven, too

My Heart Will Go On~
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how i know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you've opened the door
And you're here in my heart 
And my heart will go on and on
Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're one
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold you
In my life will always go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you've opened the door
And you're here in my heart 
And my heart will go on and on
There is some love that will not go away
You're here, there's nothing I fear
And i know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Whiskey In The Jar~
As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said "Stand and deliver or the devil he may take you"
Yeah
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me, no, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy
Musha rain dum-a-do-dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Taking money with me and I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven, yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired my pistols, and I shot him with both barrels, yeah
Musha rain dum-a-do-dum-a-da, yeah-yeah
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah, whiskey
Yo-ooh, whiskey
Yo-ooh, yeah, ooh
Yo-oo-ooh, yeah
Now some men like the fishing and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear, to hear the cannonball a-roaring
Me I like sleeping, especially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah
Musha rain dum-a-do-dum-a-da, yeah-yeah
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Whiskey in the jar-o, yeah
Musha rain dum-a-do-dum-a-da
Musha rain dum-a-do-dum-a-da, hey
Musha rain dum-a-do-dum-a-da
Musha rain dum-a-do-dum-a-da

Turn the Page~
On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out as one note song
You think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you're riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
And you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through
Here I am - on the road again
There I am - up on the stage
Here I go - playing star again
There I go - turn the page
So you walk into this restaurant strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
Oh, the same old cliches, "Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand
Make your stand
Here I am - on the road again
There I am - up on the stage
Here I go - playing star again
There I go - turn the page
Oo-ooh, out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy you try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play, yeah
Later in the evening, you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
What she said
He-ey
Yeah
Here I am - on the road again
There I am - up on the stage
Here I go - playing star again
There I go - turn the page
There I go - turn that page
There I go, yeah, yeah
There I go, yeah, yeah
There I go, yeah
There I go, yeah
There I go, oo-oo-ooh
There I go
And I'm gone
