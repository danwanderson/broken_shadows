Small Black Bat~
`KSmall Black Bat`w~
`KThe small black bat mesmerizes you with it's wings.`w
~
This "small" black bat has a wing span of about 6 feet. His long, sharp wings 
tell you quickly how this animal attacks. He is a graceful flier and calms 
you as you watch him swoop in and out of the trees. His sharp canine teeth 
points out his love of meat. Obviously a member of the Phyllostomadae.

The Forest~
You are at the edge of the forest.  Ahead of you, behind a wide moat, you
can see a large fortress.  Whoever lives here must not like visitors much. 
As you pick your way through the underbrush, the drawbridge opens and a
rider passes over it, heading for a small path off to your right. 
Fortunately, he didn't see you.

as you go onward on the path.  Looking south you see a path leading away
from this quite intimidating Castle.  Looking north you see the path, which
leads to the Castle.  `w

The path leads up to what appears to be two huge doors, several hundred
yards to the north.  There is a huge hedge to the east and west of you which
stands around 12' high.  The razor sharp thorns forces you to continue north
or south.  You think you see a break in the hedge big enough to go through
to the northeast but you can't be sure.  `w

realize that the fence surrounded nothing except a large wall.  The doorway
is now only a short distance away.  You want to turn around but you trek
onward...  The wall is now in front of you...  The cold gray stone extend to

sharp edged swords, axes, and daggers everywhere.  The quality of
workmanship is unmatched in all of your travels.  The prices of the items

This is a completely hidden room.  You would never have thought it here. 
It is hidden in a tiny little niche in the wall.  Oh well you can still buy
a pet from here.  There may be a nice one for you to use.  It is always nice

are blacked out and the bed has been replaced by four small coffins.  You

`cThe Lobby of the Innes Street Inn`w~
`yThis is the main lobby of the once great inn.  The front desk is right
in front of you and there is a grand staircase that is on both sides of the
desk.  The cathedral high ceilings are covered in an ornate gold trim and
the smooth painted walls are now covered in fine, beautifully painted
tapestries.  You examine the hard floor and see that there was once a carpet
that covered the entire floor.  The commonroom is to the east through a
grand archway.  There is a small office to the north, behind the desk.  `w

`y Ahh!!!  You bet there were some good times here.  There are many
tables here still with large mugs of beer.  There is a stage to the north of
you that was where the jugglers and bards used to entertain the high class
people who frequented this fine establishment.  There is a doorway, which
stands opens, to the east that leads to the kitchen.  The room is more
brightly lit than anywhere else you have seen in the castle and you can see
all the decorations which are all over the room.  The only complaint of such
a place is the odor of burning hair.  Nevertheless this room is one of the
nicest that you have ever seen.  The archway to the west leads back to the

cleaning and cooking although they don't look to be of much interest.  There
