Walking further south, you come across the master bath.  And the other
powder rooms were big?  Ha!  This one laughs in comparison.  A pool is
streched out before you, a gorgeous, blue color.  Some rafts are floating in
it, and a smaller room is towards the back, undoubtedly the actual bathroom.
Palm trees delicately wave over the edge of the pool, and music is being
played here, softly.

residential road, while to the east the road becomes much darker.  Rows of
houses can just about be seen to the west, while to the east is nothing but
trees.  Directly forward the road abruptly ends, becoming a beautiful jade
carved gate.  A regal, intricately designed castle lies beyond the gates,
surrounded by waterfalls and lush landscaping.  However, there appears to be
no easy way in, and getting through the gates is impossible.

solutions are drawn, but you cannot tell what it all means.  Giving up, you
place the book back on the shelf, and start to walk away.  As you approach
the next room, you hear a subtle boom, and spin around to see a book fall
from the section you were just in.  You decide not to pick it up.

A Path in the Forest~
A bloody carcass is lying here, just off the path.  Several birds and
small animals are gathered around it, living off the dead.  Through closer
inspection, it appears rather fresh, the blood staining the side of the path
and the grass a deep red.

A Path in the Forest~
It is becoming colder, the wind briskly shaking the trees, causing some leaves to sprinkle the ground.
The smell of decay is becoming unbearable, as you undoubtedly step closer to the source.

A Path in the Forest~
This section of the path looks like it has not been tread on in months. 
A decaying tree lies halfway on the road and partially on the grass, acting
as a home for many bugs.  Leaves completely cover the walkway, and with each
step, some small animals flee from underneath them.  The end is not near.

A Path in the Forest~
The forest is becoming more dense, the path narrowing a touch.  Foliage
lines the road and grows in-between the many old trees, along with some
scattered wildflowers.  Bugs fly and walk all around you, making you itch in
paranoia.

A Path in the Forest~
The dark and damp forest is completely encapsulating, it is almost as
though nothing else but this exists.  It is a world of its own, but of what
and where does it lead?

A Path in the Forest~
Scary enough, there appears to be nothing but trees further down. 
However, the forest is so dense and dark that it is hard to see much of
anything.  Squirrels skamper loudly only a foot away, apparently in a hurry
somewhere.

A Path in the Forest~
The path appears to just....  End.  If the path *does* continue on, it
would be impossible to do so due to the density of the trees ahead.  The
path right under your feet is a different shade than the rest of the path,
and is also an odd texture in comparison.  This journey appears to be a
waste.

The Catacombs~
There seems to be an underworld underneath the real world.  It is damp
and completely dark down here, the walls carved out of stone.  Exits lie in
almost all directions, except down, each one leading to blackness.
