The Owl and The Statue~
A large gargoyle statue sits nestled amoung some dark bushes.  A snowy
owl sits on the gargoyle's wing and stares at you with big yellow eyes,
luring you closer.  As you draw near, the owl hoots and flies away, leaving
a shimmering portal in front of you.

On A Hilltop~
You look about you and find yourself in a strange world.  Far off to the
north, you see a magnificent castle through the hazy morning sun.  All
around the castle, from this advantage point atop a small hill, you can see
a huge maze surrounding it...  The Labyrinth...  Beside you is an old dead
tree with a beautiful snowy owl sitting on a gnarled branch, watching you
closely.

The Great Doors~
Reaching the bottom of the hill, you come to a flat area infront of a high
stone wall surrounding the Labyrinth.  Flying around you are tiny fairies.
One flies up to you and gives a sharp bite.  Not as nice as you thought
fairies were!  Looking to your left, you see a startled goblin quickly doing
his pants up again after using the pond for 'other' things.  He points
you in the direction of the Doors as to the enterance to the Labyrinth and 
continues to kill fairies -- 51...52...53...

The Corridor~
You gasp in astonishment as the doors suddenly close behind you with a
resounding 'clang', and you find yourself very alone in a long corridor. 
You shiver slightly as it seems much colder and darker here.  Looking to
your left and right, all you see is the same corridor, never ending or
turning.  Around you lie stumps of logs and strange little bushes trying to
grow.  The stone walls stand maybe thirteen feet high, and look to be
covered in a strange slime.  You come to realise that there is no turning
back now...

Outside the Labyrinth~
The area is flat with little grass growing around the base of a great
vine-covered stone wall which surrounds the Labyrinth.  Peeking out from
some bluebell flowers are some fairies, and others are flying about
seemingly on an errand of great importance.  The wall seems to continue off
into the horizon in a straight line from here, and the only difference is
where you just came from with the small pond.

The Corridor~
Never turning or changing in any way, the corridor continues on.  Dodging
dead branches, you continue onward, needing to get into the Labyrinth ... 
to the Goblin King's Castle.

The Corridor~
This part looks exactly like the rest of the corridor, except for one
small, very small, difference.  Along a small ledge in the wall, a tiny blue
worm is looking at you.  With a thick British accent, he says, "'Allo.  Why
don't you come in and meet the missus for a nice spot of tea?"  Frusterated,
and not needing to waste time, you lean against one wall and feel something
change...

Another Corridor~
Emerging from the grey corridor, you step out into a much more friendly
and bright setting.  The walls are still made of stone, but they are barren
of growth and stone sculptures can be seen in nooks and crannies.  Even the
atmosphere seems friendly with birds chirping and the sun shining down on
you.
